Welcome to *Curiosity Killed the Cat.*

My name is Aleksandar Ratesic, I live in Zagreb, Croatia. The purpose of this website is to showcase the analyses I perform to satisfy my curiosity. Curiosity probably won't kill me like it killed the cat, but I should consider limiting the amount of coffee I drink.
