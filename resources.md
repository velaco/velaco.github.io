## Books

### R

[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/){:target="blank"} - I got this book before I could really understand it, but now I love it. The link will take you to the companion website, where you can read it online, or you can get a [physical copy from Amazon](https://amzn.to/2yzIsmF){:target="blank"}. 

[Machine Learning with R](https://amzn.to/2SlixYb){:target="blank"} - This book was my first contact with machine learning. It provides a great overview of machine learning algorithms and serves as a great reference point for more advanced topics in R and machine learning.

## Job Boards
